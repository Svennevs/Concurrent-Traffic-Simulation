# Summary
This repo contains a simple traffic simulation making use of concurrency. It was my submission for the project of the concurrency course of the Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program.
Included are some vehicles, crossings and some traffic lights. Message queues are used for thread-safe communication between vehicles, intersections and traffic lights.
